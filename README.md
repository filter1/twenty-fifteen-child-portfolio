# Twenty Fifteen Child Portfolio

This is a child theme to showcare my projects. It is based on the theme Twenty Fifteen . 

To use it, create a 'Projects' page with the content [wpb_childpages].

For each project, create a sub-page of 'Projects' page. Set a featured image of 500x500 px and specify the published date (if needed). The order is used for the Project grid (it is not dependant on the published date (couldn't make it work)). The newest projects needs the lowest number in the order field. (Same Problem as above). In the content of each project, the thumbnail is disabled. So choose another, bigger image/video. In addition, I state the published date (manually) and a link back to projects over (manually).
