# Twenty Fifteen Child Portfolio

This is a child theme of [Twenty Fifteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/) to showcase my projects.

## Usage

1.  Install and activate the theme.
2.  Create a 'Projects' page with the content [wpb_childpages].
3.  For each project, create a sub-page of 'Projects' page.

For the individual projet pages, consider the following:

- Set a featured image of 500x500 pixels.
- Set the published date to date the project was released.
- The order is used for the Project grid (it is not dependant on the published date (couldn't make it work)). The newest projects needs the lowest number in the order field.
- In the content of each project, the thumbnail is disabled. So choose another, bigger image.
- In the content of the page, state the published date (manually) and a link back to the 'Projects' page (manually).
